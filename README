ctm2git
-------

Synthesize a packaging repo from the history of source packages in CTM.

In an empty directory:
- Run 'ctm2git PACKAGENAME >tempfile'
- Edit tempfile to replace 'unknown <unknown@unknown.invalid>' with maintainer details for each version
- run 'ctm2git PACKAGENAME --sourcelist tempfile' to create git repo

Note that on the first run this will download all historic setup.ini files from
CTM, which may take a while. These files are cached for subsequent runs.
